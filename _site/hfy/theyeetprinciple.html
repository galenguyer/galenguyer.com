        <h1>The Yeet Principle</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>All apes are capable of flinging shit, be it metaphorical or literal, but these sons of bitches combined their bipedal stance, binocular vision, opposable thumbs and tool use to raise flinging shit to an art. Not content with using their own bodies, already capable of beaning another person from range with a thrown object even at a very young age--ask any human about the sport they call "dodgeball" and try not to hurl--they developed all sorts of tools, machines, and even explosives to aid them in the task. And on top of the various conventional ammunition developed throughout humanity's history, from a rock all the way up to orbital nuclear bombardment and beyond, there seemed to be no limit to what a human would try flinging.</p>
        <p>Never mind if it wasn't aerodynamic.</p>
        <p>Never mind if it wasn't ever designed to be a projectile in the first place.</p>
        <p>Never mind if it was alive--or sapient--at launch.</p>
        <p>Never mind if it hadn't agreed to being used as a projectile.</p>
        <p>Never mind if it survived the process or not.</p>
        <p>Never mind if it was effective for anything except to cause even the most hard-bitten and world weary the reaction of "What the Fuck!"</p>
        <p>And whenever asked about their justification for such unconventional methods, they almost always trot out The Usual Suspects, to wit:</p>
        <p>"I dunno."</p>
        <p>"Seemed like a good idea at the time."</p>
        <p>"Look, I was [in some state of impaired judgement, subcategory: youth, recklessness, impairment, panic, dare, etc., or some or all of the above], okay?"</p>
        <p>"What's not to love about an [X] that throws/shoots [Y]?"</p>
        <p>And, of course, the perennial favorite response of a human engaged in Flinging Shenanigans:</p>
        <p>"Because fuck you, that's why."</p>
